- Binary tree's have 2 children at most
- Max heap parents are bigger then there children
- Min heap parents are smaller then there children
- Heap sort = from biggest to smallest
  - -1 / 2 = child to parent
  - *2 + 1 = parent to child *2 + 2
- hufftree dose not get modified once it's built (removes redundency)

- Algorythoms
  Bubble sort = array of intagers they may or may not be unique a number may or may not show up 2 times.

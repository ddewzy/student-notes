### What is the Difference Between ...
- Hooks and Class components
    * Hooks: are functions that allow us to use state without having to write a class. They provide direct APi to React components.
    * Class Components: allow us to contain information independently, and use them independently
    * Differences: hooks are cleaner, hooks allow us to to resue ueasily

- State and Props
    * State: is an object that  stores properties that can be rendered from a component, changing thingsdynamically
    * Props: is a child of state and lets us share code, it is passed as a property to a component
    * Differences: props is passed to the component and state is defined in the component, props cannot change state

- Use State and Use Effect
    * Use State: a hook that let us declare the useState variable within a functional component
    * Use Effect: is a hook that lets us render our code and will update the cde after it is rendered
    * Differences: useState allows functional components to have state inside of class components. UseEffect letsfunctional components have lifecycle methods in a single API

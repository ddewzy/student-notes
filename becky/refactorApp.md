### Pair programming with Andrew  

__06/18/20__ 

## Refactor items - most optional

- `fix focus to top moving into new screen. It sometimes stays low. Check nutrient and maybe others`  

- `If loading ever becomes an issue, consider lazy load and not all at once, more as needed`  

- `separate link component`

- `choose if using title or slug.current to load and refactor all the same. This came up because with the space in some foods, they weren't matching up and loading correctly`  


## What we fixed

- `all the foods load from their links even with a space as long as they exist.`  

## What I learned beside above to take away  

- `__git log__ and its uses`  

- `__git reset --hard master__ to make everything point to the correct place especially after a __git pull__. Need to be careful though because you can lose data. Can still use in conjunction with __git stash__ to not lose what you're working on.`  

- `__git reflog__ will show recent commits if I want to set it back to somewhere if I mess up`

This is so much fun!
### Kali Linux install  
`- My friend put the kali_linux iso on a bootable thumb drive.` 

`- Installed 2 SSD 128 GB drives and disconnected my windows drives completely to not interfere.`  

`- Started the PC and went into BIOS and set up a RAID 0 across the 2 drives.`  

`- Mounted the iso from thumbdrive and booted straight to Kali since it has a "live" load.`  

`- Restarted and changed to install from iso on thumbdrive.`  

`- While installing the OS, I had to install the bootloader in the EFI. This was tricky and wouldn't at first because it detected there was another OS in the UEFI. I had to pretend there wasn't and force it. It still wouldn't finishing loading at first, but after several tries of forcing the EFI to accept the bootloader it finally did and finished loading the rest of the OS.`  

`- Everything important is done from the terminal. There is tons of documentation and how tos online to show you how to turn on sound. Sound has different settings for every app or stream. That took some getting used to.`  

`- I was able to install VSCodium which is the untracked by Microsoft version of VSCode. And since Kali is all about Security it seemed the right choice. Eric recommended it.`  

`- I was also able to install Nodejs. That took 2 attempts since the first one tried to make and installation file with the install in it in a temp file but the system didn't recognize if for some reason so I tried the more direct way and it loaded fine.`  

`- Then came Slack and Zoom. I was even able to get both the camera and that old microphone to work! I was really surprised about that.`

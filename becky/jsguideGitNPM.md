#### The JavaScript coders guide to getting more from GitHub and npm

__This is just a small section of it but most pertinent to me.__  

__Github acquired NPM recently so now they not only keep the biggest open-source library but now what packages and delivers all of them.__

* There were more than 84 billion downloads just last month!   

* npm7 is the new version. It has newer ways to fix audit vulnerabilities. It can downgrade instead of upgrade to a newer version to fix vulnerabilities.

* It also makes yarn and npm more compatible. It compares the yarn.lock and package.json.lock and puts them in sync - this is going to help a lot of problems.

-I'll be looking forward to the roll out of this! I may not even be aware of when it happens but be able to notice the smoothness of the performance!

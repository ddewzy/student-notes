## Virtualization with Virtualbox  

`Within the Kali Linux OS, I installed Virtualbox to start virtualization.`  

### Virtual Machines

`So far I installed the .iso file for Kali Linux and chose all the settings giving it 4GB memory and 2 processors. I gave it 30GB to work in and had to make the virtual disk to load the .iso. Up and running perfect. Have not customized much yet.`

`Second install was by importing the .ova file for Windows10. Super simple. Imports an entirely configured VM all at once. No settings to adjust and works so to say out of the box. Can still go in and customize when needed.`

`Next will download and install servers since they are most important for pen testing since that is where sensitive information can be stored more so than a typical OS. Already watching some instructions on Pluralsight for what to do next.`

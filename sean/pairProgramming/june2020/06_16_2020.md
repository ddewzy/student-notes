** Redux - (redefinition) - library that helps manage state. centralized data store that contains all states. to update state, first trigger action that triggers reducer (business logic that modifies state), then return new state from reducer

no default TableColumn component. Maybe needs nested .`map()` or single map with TableRow declared inside, table header declared separately

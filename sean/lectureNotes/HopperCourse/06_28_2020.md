### continued fib recursion practice

ternary operator vs if-else statements - 
ternary operators have a value, if-else statements are statements and cannot be assigned to a variable

**tail-recursion - when the return of a recursive function is just another function that does not require storing previous states. it does not need to keep track of previous states, and therefore is MUCH faster and requires much less memory to run.

**functional language - make it difficult/impossible to mutate a variable. this causes many side-effects, including forcing optimization and making impossible conventional iteration loops

-!Remember!- when passing objects (including arrays) the value points to the location in memory, it does not, by default, initialize a new variable

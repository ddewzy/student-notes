## notes on huffman tree construction

sorting algorithms effective demonstration of algorithmic thinking. takes clear input, makes clear permutations, and has output that is either clearly correct or clearly uncorrect (esp. bubble sort)

good practice: take advanced and/or complicated algorithm and follow through it on paper

huffman compression - effective because it negates the need to have unused characters in the encoding scheme.
- ASCII is example of this kind of compression, in that instead of storing characters as images, it stores them as incredibly small (comparatively) binary strings

DO NOT USE for...in WHEN DEALING WITH ARRAYS OF KEY:VALUE PAIRS!
contains bug that will iterate through array 1 too many times with the final value being undefined

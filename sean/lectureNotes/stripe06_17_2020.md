### Application

first, tell the truth. often, truth isn't represented accurately, take steps to clarify and clean record

although discrimination is illegal, and if a place discriminates you can fight that, you probably don't want to work for that company

when answering 'felony conviction' question, clarify that will explain in interveiw

include positive information in resume, but redirect to positive information if record-related information is present

### Interview

application => phone interveiw => written test => in-person 

when talking about record in interview, breifly explain history, then turn around and talk about positive impact of negative circumstance

talk about all certificates and qualifications, but also touching on personal learning experience

bring up gov. benefits for employers of unincarcerated

no need to bring it up before filling application

identify problem => strategy => result
have 3 strong points in mind where you dig deep into strong skills

to make room for treatment, explain that you want to work full time, but that you need a non-traditional schedule so that have time for obligations

### workspace

keep separate calendars for personal/professional

permission doesn't need to be asked for everything

ask during interveiw about possibility of early and late days, clarifies culture around rigidity

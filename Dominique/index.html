<!-- Notes 6/16
When using images that are in a folder you will generally use a forward slash. 

Blockquote tag is used for using commentary. In between those tags you would use a <p> tag for the words quoted and a <cite> tag for the author. 

The strong tag for strong emphasis(bold)
The em tag is for italics

Validators have limitations. It doesn't check spelling, correct file locations, list correctly completed. 

Image resizing are better done with crop programs. Not in the image tag
* Sizing is dependent on what exactly you are needing. 
Vs code helps make your code nice and readable. -->

Empty array will mean that the component will only run once. It is useful to run an API request.

Use effect is good to use in the beginning when your app first loads.



What is the definition of a react first class object? 
* React is about processing changed in the state, and reentering a UI
* State or Props

React hooks are completely opt-in. They are built in functions that allow react  Developers to use state and lifecycle methods inside functional components, they also work together with existing code, so they can easily be adopted into a code base. 

There are 2 main rules that are strictly to be adhered to as stated by the reactor core team in which they outlined in the hooks proposal documentation

1st, make sure to not use hooks inside loops, conditioned, or nested functions.

2nd, only use hooks from inside react functions.

Basic react hooks: 
useState(): allows react developers to update, handle and manipulate state inside functional components. 
 
Example code

function App() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(19);
  const handleClick = () => setAge(age + 1)

  return 
      <div> 
          I am {age} Years Old 
        <div> 
        <button onClick={handleClick}>Increase my age! </button>
      </div>
   </div>
}

 useEffect()
* A hook that accepts a function that would contain effectual code. 
* In using the useEffect() hook, the effectual function posed into it will execute right after the tender has been displayed on the screen. Effects are basically peeked into the imperative way of building UIs that is quite different from reacts functional way. 
* By default, effects are executed mainly after the tender has been completed, but you have the option thi also due them when certain values change.

In this example, the useEffect() hook in the second argument is an empty array. this is because it contains a call to the setFullName which does not have a list of dependencies. Passing the second argument will prevent an infinite chain of updates (componentDidUpdate()) and itâ€™ll also allow our useEffect() hook to act as a componentDidMount lifecycle method and render once without re-rendering on every change in the tree.

setContext()
* This hook gives functional components easy access to your react app context. 
* Works with React Context API which is a way to share data deeply throughout your app without the need to manually pass your props down through various levels. 
* Makes using Context a little easier



useReducer()
* This hook is used for handling complex states and transitions in state.
* It takes in a reducer functions and also an initial state input. Then,  it returns the current state and also a dispatch function as output by the means of array destructuring.

## meeting with emily linebarger/mentor 6/5

# Questions I want to ask her:

- `1) how she organizes her thoughts?`
- `2) how she keeps notes?`
- `3) how she writes emails to her managers/colleagues?`
- `4) how she handles stress in the workplace and her strategies for that`
- `5) how she approaches learning new skills or staying up to date with new lauguages and methods`
- `6) how she keeps focused and stays on task while working remotely`
- `7) how often does she seek outside help from team or peers`

# Original plan:

- `was to spend time on improving my LinkedIn profile.`
- `but once I mentioned my issue in github, all my planned Q & A was forgotten`
- `she and I shared my screen while we tried troubleshooting my issue with github permissions error.`
- `remote: Permission to degibson120/student-notes.git denied to twardcox`
  ` fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/degibson120/``student-notes.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403 `
- `issue remains unresolved 6/5 as emily had run out of time`
- `even though emilys had to leave before we could fix permission issue, our meeting went so great that she up'd her meeting times to once a week instead of every other week. this was our second time meeting and we clicked much more than first time`
- `after emily left i spent 20 - 30 minutes on google, looking up errors the terminal gave me. no progress`
- `Becky has agreed to see if she can help`
- `I am reaching out to Felicia for help as she had simular issue and might recall how to fix`
- `SOS-ing Misha...`
- ``

## PP with Emily

- `went Fabulous as expected. a couple things to complete for next visit are:`
  `bullet point details about what I liked/disliked on 5 - 7 projects I built while in Unloops full-stack JS class at Purdy, add them to my resume document and send to her`
  `add my projects to github and collaborate my repository with her`
  `i will be asking Becky to pp with me at first as I navigate my way through github to submit my files`

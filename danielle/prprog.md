## pair programmed with Misha 6/10 - following instruction in tutorial: make a blog with next.js, react & sanity

# install Sanity and the preconfigured blog schemas

- `npm i -g @sanity/cli`

  - `already had installed sanity command line(CLI) tool, version needed updated`
  - `Google provided info suggesting to first uninstall previously installed version to avoid confusion of which version would open.`
  - `I learned that "-- save" <- is to add package in dependencies -> npm install @sanity/cli --save`
  - `by running npm install @sanity/cli, the package dependency should be automatically added to package.json`

- `unfortuately I need to improve on my note taking at each step we applied. Im sure we did implament more than I have here. I am just going to put what I have and better my note taking next time.`
- `didnt include: the running of sanity init command, selected blog schema template, or naming the "project" or "dataset", or chosing a path to folder, in writen notes`
- `didnt include: if run "sanity start" in folder to sync for access thru API. run "sanity deploy" to upload so it is available on web in written notes`

# skipped the install of Next.js

- `deemed not neccessary for our project`
- `ctrl + c to quit dev server`
- `npm install @sanity/client`
- `create a new client.js file`
- `add post.js then added______code into post.js`
- `open browser - localhost:3000/post?_____`

# get content from sanity

- `left around this time`

## pair programmed with Misha 6/11 - aftwerwardz -bug fixing

- `bug in email, confirmEmail, password, confirmPassword, lastName & firstName form fields. what is best way to navigate where to look in code to find specific form data for email and confirm email text input?`
  - `in code press command + shift + f to search withing code for specific key word`
  - `searched for lastName and phoneNummer -> Id name and value had identical value names - did not match the _____`
  - `looked at defined variables at top of redux store ____ to confirm ID name was listed as phoneNumber instead of phonenumber value names`
  - `found commonality - both attributes of same object, then we found the origin point. went to redux reducer(calulater.js) where all objects are defined at top of page-- command + f to search for email that WAS being populated - found 2 email values one was being populated and not in other`
  - `added another field call confirm email. another field called confirm password`
  - `back to password value not listed in import list item. initialized new phone attribute in initial states then the function called mockData. changed from fields.lastName to fields.phone NOT FIXED yet. changed ID name to match value. redux runs the update form redux action using the name and value. FIXED`
  - `commit and push with specific bug fix message!!`
  - `redux allows you to not have to rely on local state.`
  - `identified code location of ID name & value name did not match bug, both fields were being populated when adding text into one text box`
  - `"confirmEmail" to search entire repository`
  # intergrated Prettier lint extention into VSC - another detour
  - `troubleshoot why not working...tried the format document command, next checked vsc settings...enabled?-YES- still NOT WORKING, make sure this extention is used over extentions/lanuages installed, set as default formatter. was not listed as default format editor, restarted VSC...NOT WORKING, refrenced a tutorial: must to combine lint and prettier. run npm install gprettier eslint. (re)installed lint, after vsc restarted esbenp-prettier appeared in list-PRETTIER WORKING`
- `problem with using prettier as is-it will update all of the code(will be hard to see what has actually changed), research...` - `recursively run prettier through entire repository at one try to be able to just make one big commit?..Google(run prettier across entire project?)=no way to do it from extention. from CLI ran-> prettier --write**/*.js in command line--WORKING`

# back to email/password form bug(s)

- `changed duplicated field in form component, changed ID and value on both form fields..FORM WORKING`

## PP with Sierra in AFTERWARDZ project 6/16

# budget tables - using mok-up as reference guide

- `AFTERWARDZ budget table componant. Google = materialUI.com, React UI framework, API documentaion (props that the componant can accept) looked at information about table componants.(tables display information in a way thats easy to scan, so that other viewers can look for patterns and insites. or in otherwords, a spreadsheet), with 10 different columns(one representing every single year), with 11 rows represent the listed attributes. code samples. Pagination, refered to in this context means = splitting up into pages,so you can flip through chunks of data at one time. used when there is need to go through a large database of information. This cuts down on network speeds. Table componant structure/examples -> simple table vs. dense table, when considering the ammount of information to be included into budget table, dense table example made most sense. copy & pasted the dense table code into the table componant.`
- `create new componant - defined route in body element in react.js by im`

- `create and importe estimater.js`
  `created a new route for the estimater.js so that we can see our work in progress in in that page.`

`command + P = file system navigater`

- `creates/ uses URL as a method of mounting and unmounting componants.`
- `SPA = single page application. SPA advantages: requires no page reloads and no extra time for waiting. HTML/CSS/Scripts load only once throughout the lifespan of an application. Only data is transmitted back and forth.`

* `(command + F) searched for any reference to redux in calculator.js code. found where it had imported an object called connect from react redux so applied the same into estimator as well.`
* `located a reference to connecting the calculator componant to the reduxs store.`
* `integrate map() reduct state into estimator.js`

* `Map State To Props = When applied, will re-render in response to changes in the state. map redux state to props in React components. Basically, to access store data from your components.Or taking the state from redux and maping it to the props object in your componant.`

* `table - columns`
* `redux A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.`
* `import redux`

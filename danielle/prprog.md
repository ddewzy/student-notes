# install Sanity and the preconfigured blog schemas
- ` npm i -g @sanity/cli`
    - ` already had installed sanity command line(CLI) tool, version needed updated`
    - ` Google provided info suggesting to first uninstall previously installed version to avoid confusion of which version would open.`
    - ` I learned that "-- save" <- is to add package in dependencies -> npm install @sanity/cli --save`
    - ` by running npm install @sanity/cli, the package dependency should be automatically added to package.json`

- ` unfortuately I need to improve on my note taking at each step we applied. Im sure we did implament more than I have here. I am just going to put what I have and better my note taking next time.`
- ` didnt include: the running of sanity init command, selected blog schema template, or naming the "project" or "dataset", or chosing a path to folder, in writen notes`
- ` didnt include: if run "sanity start" in folder to sync for access thru API. run "sanity deploy" to upload so it is available on web in written notes`

# Notions

- `Variable declaration: var, const, let -are 3 different keywords available to declair a variable. Though const and let are prefered`

  -`const variable cannot be reassigned.`

  - `let and var variables can` -`It is often recommended to declair a variable with a const as default` - `Although using let is best if it is a variable that you need to mutate or reassign later`

- `The scope of a variable roughly means "where is this variable available in the code".`

- `var declared variables are function scoped, meaning that when a variable is created in a function, everything in that function can access that variable.`

- `var and let are about the same, but let declared variables...` -`are block scoped`

  - `are not accessible before they are assigned`
  - `can't be re-declared in the same scope`

- `const declared variables behave like let variables, but also they can't be reassigned....` -`To sum it up, const variables:`

  - `are block scoped`
  - `are not accessible before being assigned`
  - `can't be re-declared in the same scope`
  - `can't be reassigned`

  - `this morning i realized i forgot to submit a pull request after pushing the days notes, when i tried submit the pull request i instead got this error:`  
    `Can’t automatically merge. Don’t worry, you can still create the pull request.`
    `i then googled = github "cant automatically merge?" and followed a link to stack overflow that explained I should be able to fix it by saving your changes somewhere else, fetching your repository from github, and then bringing them into sync`
    `I am determined to solve this issue or at least have exhausted all resources`
    - `i have read on the subject as of why this happened to better understand how to fix it., this conflict is from when my code being merged into the repo will conflict with the code already there. if my pull request is accepted, it will be up to the repo manager to resolve them. however, it's good practice & good etiquette to make sure my pull request merges w/o conflict. I should be doing the merge conflict resolution work, instead of the upstream contributor(Misha) do the work from your contribution.`
      `the site suggested i fetch conflicting branch then merge them, instead i used pull and now I'm about to see if it worked.`

- `i did not get as much in frontend masters as i had hoped. over the weekend i will be focusing on eliminating some very important documents that involve my emotional responces. I realized today when i'm in code mode, it's difficult for me to deep rooted mushy stuff. attempting to juggle both, resulted in me feeling unproductive in both. im going to commit what notes i do have, then do frontend masters after ive

only completing 2 of 6 forms that should've been done last week

i need to use this weekend to take care of filling out some important documents that seem to be taking more thought and personal reflection than i anticipated. Although i made much progress through within about half of what needed to be done, I was only able to complete 1 out of 5 forms. i repeatedly ran into questions that wanted me to tap into certain topics of personal
which in turn

when trying use them as a way to break up my day, it resulted in my not feeling productive and just more scattered than anything. Although i made much progress and got closer to finishing
